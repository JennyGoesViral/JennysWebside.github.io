					<p class="tm-box-p">Physical inactivity, frequent sitting and unhealthy diets are widespread. Such unhealthy behaviours put cardiovascular health at risk. Conventional interventions to promote a healthy lifestyle are usually effective but also costly. Wearable trackers, especially Fitbit devices, could provide a cost-effective alternative to help many people become more physically fit and maintain good health.</p>

								<h1>Short-review of meta-analysis</h1>
								
								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p class="tm-box-p">Unhealthy behaviours, such as physical inactivity, sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diets, remain widespread and are a considerable challenge worldwide. These problems are linked to mental health issues, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and a shorter life expectancy. Despite this, only a minority of the population has a healthy
									lifestyle and meets the general recommendations of 10,000 steps and 20 minutes of moderate to intense physical activity per day.
									</p>								
								<p class="tm-box-p">This meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of Fitbit-based interventions on healthy lifestyle outcomes compared with nonwearable control groups.  </p>
								
								<h2>What is this study about?</h2>
								<p class="tm-box-p">(1) Evaluate the effectiveness of interventions involving a Fitbit device on healthy lifestyle outcomes (e.g., steps, moderate to vigorous physical activity, and weight).</p>
								<p class="tm-box-p">(2) Identify the most effective additional intervention components in improving healthy lifestyle outcomes.</p>
								
								<h2>What is this study about?</h2>
								<p class="tm-box-p"> 
									<ul>
										<li>Statistically significant increase in daily step count. The mean difference was 951 steps per day (95% CI 475.89-1425.18; p <.001).</li>
										<li>Statistically significant increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The mean difference was 6 minutes per day (95% CI 2.80-9.51; p <.001). </li>
										<li>Significant decrease in weight, on average 1.5 kg (95% CI −2.81 to −0.14; p =.03). </li>
										<li>Nonsignificant decrease in objectively assessed and self-reported sedentary behaviour. </li>
										<li>Setting activity goals was the most important additional part of the interventions. That was investigated by subgroup analyses and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. </li>	
									</ul>
								</p>
								
								<h2>Quality of the meta-analysis?</h2>								
								<p class="tm-box-p">
								<b>M</b>agnitude: Although the findings were insignificant in all included studies, short-term interventions utilising a Fitbit device improved a healthy lifestyle. The authors did not mention an effect size.    
								</p>
								<p class="tm-box-p">
								<b>A</b>rticulation: Most parts of the meta-analysis are written in a simple language and can also be understood by non-experts. Only the region with the unique analysis was hard to understand. We had to look up terms and descriptions in the appendix. 
							    </p>
								<p class="tm-box-p">
								<b>G</b>enerality: The results are specific, mainly for adult populations with pre-existing chronic conditions. There is no evidence of effects among children and adolescents. In the meantime, the Fitbit devices used in most studies are obsolete. There are many new models with additional features.   
							    </p>
								<p class="tm-box-p">
								<b>I</b>nterestingness: It is a relevant and currently debated topic of great importance. But additional future research is necessary. The results indicate that goal setting is a practical complementary interventional component.  
							    </p>
								<p class="tm-box-p">
								<b>C</b>redibility: They included only randomised control trials and assessed each study for risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration seven domain-based criteria. But the included studies rarely described the wearable and ignored its specific features.
								</p>

								<h2>Conclusion for research and relevant stakeholders</h2>
								<p class="tm-box-p">
									Fitbit devices in interventions can promote healthy lifestyles in terms of physical activity and weight. Fitbit devices may be helpful to health professionals for patient monitoring and support.
									The studies in the meta-analysis included primarily adult populations with pre-existing chronic conditions.
									Future research should also focus on the effectiveness of such interventions in healthy individuals, children, and adolescents. 
									In addition, they should consider subjective outcomes, such as psychological health variables. 
									In this meta-analysis, the Fitbit device mainly was a small part of a combination of different interventions. Further research would be helpful to determine the effect of a wearable independent of other
									intervention components. The results of long-term use of physical activity trackers should also be investigated. The impact of the various behaviour change techniques in trackers is also essential for future research.
									In summary, it can be said that physical activity trackers positively affect health. How significant these effects are, which device components and for which target groups tracking is particularly useful still needs to be investigated.

							<h1>Utilizing wearable technology to increase physical activity in future physicians: <br/>  A randomized trial</h1>
							<h2>What was done?</h2>

							<p>The study examined the use of activity trackers alone or in combination with weekly emails to investigate the effects on medical students' physical activity and body composition. One hundred twenty medical students participated in the study. They were separated into three groups: 
								<ol>
									<li>Fitbit-Only</li> The first group (Fitbit-Only) wore only the activity trackers. 
									<br><br>
									<li>Fitbit-Plus</li> The second group wore activity trackers and received weekly emails with fitness tasks and lifestyle change challenges. 
									<br><br>
									<li>Control group</li> The third group was asked not to use an activity tracker throughout the study.
										For all groups, a body composition analysis, including body fat percentage and lean body mass, was performed before the start of the study year and at the end of the first study year. Results included several steps as well.
								 </ol>
								</p>

							<h2>Main results</h2>
						
							<p>The average daily steps in the Fitbit-Plus group (7429 ± 2833) were higher than in the Fitbit-Only group (6483 ± 2359). However, the difference between the two groups was only significant in April and May. Improvements were also seen in body composition. In the Fitbit-Plus group, body fat percentage decreased in overweight women (2.1 ± 1.6%).  Lean body mass increased in overweight men in the Fitbit-Plus group (2.4 ± 4.6 lbs.).</p>

							<h2>Conclusion </h2>
							<p>Weekly behavioural prompts combined with an activity tracker increased medical students' step counts compared with an activity tracker alone. Lifestyle interventions via email while using activity trackers improved body composition in overweight medical students. </p> 
							<h2>Why is it special for me?</h2>
							<p>The study sample is medical students and young people without chronic diseases. That is why I could identify well with them. Students often experience a challenging time, especially at the beginning of their studies. They often move away from home to a new city and start a new phase of life. A healthy lifestyle, which includes enough exercise, can help them cope with these challenges and stress. Therefore, I find it interesting to investigate whether activity trackers can help to increase physical fitness. </p>
						
							<h2>Why is it an excellent example for me?</h2>

						    <p>In most of the studies in the meta-analysis, the Fitbit devices were only a tiny part of a complex intervention. Therefore, conclusions about the effectiveness of the activity trackers were usually challenging to draw. In this study, however, the focus is on the Fitbit devices.  </p>

								<h1>The impact of E-diaries and accelerometers on young adults' perceived and objectively assessed physical activity</h1>
								<h2>What was done?</h2>
								<p>The social-psychological theory suggests that electronic behavioural monitoring may influence rather than record physical activity. The following paper presents an experiment that evaluates the effect of two different commercially available technologies, e-diaries, and accelerometers, on participants’ perceived and actual PA. 146 Participants were randomly assigned to either an accelerometer-only, e-diary-only, accelerometer þ diary or a non-technology control group for one week to assess how these technologies influenced PA, both perceived and actual, in young adults. <p/>
							
							    <h2>Main results</h2>
							    <p>Average daily steps in the accelerometer-only and accelerometer e-diary groups did not differ, nor did daily reports of PA via e-diary compared to the accelerometer e-diary group, showing that neither technology affected actual PA. The accelerometer-only group had increased perceived overall PA but not compared to no-technology control. </p>
								
								<h2>Conclusion </h2>
								<p>Accelerometers may increase perceived overall PA, but the tested technologies did not increase DES or actual PA, suggesting that they may be viable unbiased measures of PA. </p>
								
								<h2>Why is it special for me?</h2>
								<p>I chose this study primarily because I like the psychological aspect of the work. I liked the idea of comparing perceived and actual physical activity. Electronic diaries and accelerometers offer many advantages, such as more accurate data collection in a natural environment.</p>
							
								<h2>Why is it an excellent example for me?</h2>
							    <p>It is interesting to determine the effects of e-diaries and accelerometers on actual PA and perceived PA since it is often used as a proxy for natural PA when the objective measurement is not available. Further, I find it interesting that perceived PA may influence natural PA indirectly, such as through self-efficacy beliefs. The study is also relevant because combining accelerometers with e-diaries could be advantageous for researchers interested in measuring intentional and incidental PA using diary methods.</p>
